Hello!

Thanks for joining me on the [Imaginary] podcast!

We're currently scheduled to record online on [date/time].

Here is a link to a doc we can use to plan questions/topics to cover: [link]

Here is a link to join the video chat when we record: [link]

We'll use a web-based tool which allows us to chat over video (similar to Skype/Hangouts/etc) and also records each of our audio locally for best audio quality.

I want you to sound your best so everyone can focus on what you say. Three main things to think about:

- Be comfortable
- Quiet space
- Headphones & Microphone - choice and placement

**Be comfy.**

If the time isn't convenient, we'll change it. The podcast will be edited, so you're welcome to say things a few ways and we'll choose the best. If you say anything you don't want included, we'll cut it. Try to find a space where you're comfortable having a relaxed conversation. 

**Find a quiet space.** 

Choose the quietest space you have available. Hopefully with low echos - larger spaces and spaces with more soft items tend to echo less.

**Choose the best microphone you have available and keep it close to your mouth.**

The single most important thing you can do to improve audio quality: **keep the mic close to your mouth** (a few inches) and out of the direct line of air. Think about holding a telephone handset: because we hold the ear piece in the same place, it holds the mic just off to the side of our mouth and in the same place over the course of the call. Ideally, you want the same thing when recoring a podcast.

Second: Headphones. Everyone needs to wear headphones so that their mic only records what they say and not the whole conversation.

Choosing a microphone, in order of quality:

- External mic
  - If you have an external mic you've used before and are comfortable with, use that. You'll have to be careful to speak from a consistent distance and stay as close as possible. 
- Headset mic
  - If you have a gaming headset or call-center style headset, these usually make for *very* consistent recordings since the mic stays in the same location as you move during the podcast. 
- earbuds with a mic
  - These tend to have OK mics, and can work fine. However, it's very easy to create loud noises as they rub against fabric. If you decide to use an earbud, it's best to hold it in your hand, away from your body for the entire recording. 
- Bluetooth anything
  - Wired is preferred, but if your don't have anything wired, a bluetooth is still likely better than other options, if you can get the mic close to your mouth and at a consistent distance. 
- Built-in laptop/tablet mic
  - Last resort.
